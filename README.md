This repository is an attempt to recreate the cursor.com website using only HTML and CSS. It serves as a hands‑on project for learning and improving front‑end development skills.

## Which sections were recreated

- Header
- Hero section
- Trusted-by
- Agents Section (Used image to create feature visual)
- Testimonials section
- Final CTA Section 
- Footer section

## Fonts and colors used
All the fonts and colors are from the original cursor.com website downloaded in assets folder.
